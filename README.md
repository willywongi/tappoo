An app for playing a game that resemble TabooÂ®. This app was written during
FirefoxOS App days in Rome from scratch using YUI. 

What's new
27-01-2013
Initial push to GitHub of the app. So far we have the first screens and a 
couple of "cards" (word to guess and word to avoid). I'm going to host the app
on github soon, in the meanwhile you can fork and clone, run npm install and run
server.js; then go to the Firefox OS Simulator and add this URL:
http://localhost:8080/manifest.webapp

Enjoy!
